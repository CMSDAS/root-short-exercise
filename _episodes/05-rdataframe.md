teaching: 10
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How can I perform efficient analysis with ROOT?"
objectives:
- "Understand the concept of declarative programming"
- "Learn about the basics of RDataFrame"
- "Find out how to run your analysis on multiple threads"
keypoints:
- "`RDataFrame` is the recommended entry point for efficient analysis"
- "`RDataFrame` follows a declarative workflow: Declare first what you want to do and let ROOT run all of your tasks as efficiently as possible in one go, in parallel!"
- "Parallelization on multiple threads requires only the `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT()` statement"

> ## Introduction to RDataFrame
> In this section, you will learn about the recommended tool to perform efficient analysis with ROOT called `RDataFrame`! `RDataFrame` enables you to run all your tasks efficiently in one go and on multiple threads.

## Implicit multi-threading in ROOT

ROOT tries to make parallelization as simple as possible for you. For this reason, we offer the feature `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT(N)`, which enables thread safety for the relevant classes and runs parallelized parts of ROOT, such as RDataFrame, implicitely on `N` threads:

```python
import ROOT

# Enable multi-threading
ROOT.EnableImplicitMT(0)
```

## RDataFrame constructor and Filter transformations

A possible way to construct an RDataFrame is passing one (ore more) filepaths and the name of the dataset (`TTree`, here called `Events`).

Next, you can build a computation graph on top of the root node returned by the constructor. The first basic transformation is applying cuts, here named a Filter node. Note that each transformation returns a new node of the graph and does not change the dataframe object itself!

```python
# Create dataframe from a (reduced) NanoAOD file
df = ROOT.RDataFrame("Events", "Run2012BC_DoubleMuParked_Muons.root")

# For simplicity, select only events with exactly two muons and require opposite charge
df_2mu = df.Filter("nMuon == 2", "Events with exactly two muons")
df_os = df_2mu.Filter("Muon_charge[0] != Muon_charge[1]", "Muons with opposite charge")
```

## Injection of C++ code and Define transformations

The next code block uses PyROOT to inject a C++ implementation of the invariant mass computation. The name of the just-in-time compiled function can be used in the Define node to add a new column to the dataset, which contains the dimuon mass.

```python
# Compute invariant mass of the dimuon system

# Perform the computation of the invariant mass in C++
ROOT.gInterpreter.Declare('''
using Vec_t = const ROOT::RVec<float>&;
float ComputeInvariantMass(Vec_t pt, Vec_t eta, Vec_t phi, Vec_t mass) {
    const ROOT::Math::PtEtaPhiMVector p1(pt[0], eta[0], phi[0], mass[0]);
    const ROOT::Math::PtEtaPhiMVector p2(pt[1], eta[1], phi[1], mass[1]);
    return (p1 + p2).M();
}
''')

# Add the result of the computation to the dataframe
df_mass = df_os.Define("Dimuon_mass", "ComputeInvariantMass(Muon_pt, Muon_eta, Muon_phi, Muon_mass)")
```

## Booking results

You can book at any point in the computation graph results, e.g., histograms or a cut-flow report. Both of them are added below. Please note that RDataFrame is declarative! This means that you do not compute right away, when you book a histogram, but you can accumulate multiple results and compute all of them in one go. The computation (or also called the event loop) is trigger just in the moment when you actually access one of the results!

```python
# Make histogram of the dimuon mass spectrum
h = df_mass.Histo1D(("Dimuon_mass", ";m_{#mu#mu} (GeV);N_{Events}", 30000, 0.25, 300), "Dimuon_mass")

# Request a cut-flow report
report = df_mass.Report()
```

## Computing the result and making a plot

As explained above, accessing a result of the computation graph triggers the event loop. Here, this happens when we access the axis of the histogram. However, you just have to remember to book all results first and then start working with the results to get all required information as fast as possible! At the end, we also print the cut flow report to investigate the efficiency of the filters.

```python
# Produce plot
ROOT.gStyle.SetOptStat(0)
ROOT.gStyle.SetTextFont(42)
c = ROOT.TCanvas("c", "", 800, 700)
h.GetXaxis().SetTitleSize(0.04); h.GetYaxis().SetTitleSize(0.04)
c.SetLogx(); c.SetLogy()
h.Draw()

label = ROOT.TLatex()
label.SetNDC(True)
label.SetTextSize(0.040)
label.DrawLatex(0.100, 0.920, "#bf{CMS Open Data}")
label.DrawLatex(0.550, 0.920, "#sqrt{s} = 8 TeV, L_{int} = 11.6 fb^{-1}")

# Save as png file
c.SaveAs("dimuon_spectrum.png")

# Print cut-flow report
report.Print()
```

```
Events with exactly two muons: pass=31104343   all=61540413   -- eff=50.54 % cumulative eff=50.54 %
Muons with opposite charge: pass=24067843   all=31104343   -- eff=77.38 % cumulative eff=39.11 %
```

Run the code by yourself to get a high-resolution dimuon spectrum, which shows resonances from 250 MeV to 300 GeV!

> ## Try it by yourself!
> - Assemble the code pieces and compute a high-resolution dimuon spectrum in under one minute!
> - Note that you have to keep the Python interpreter running to investigate the plot interactively. You can do this with `python -i your_script.py`
> - Does the computation time decrease with an increasing number of threads `N` in `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT(N)`?
> - Could you name the resonances?
