title: "NanoAOD analysis: Skim the initial datasets"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How can I process large amounts of data efficiently?"
- "How does an analysis with RDataFrame look like in C++?"
objectives:
- "Perform this step of the analysis by yourself"
keypoints:
- "We reduced the initial datasets by filtering suitable events and selecting interesting observables."
- "This step includes finding the interesting muon-tau pair in each selected event."
- "To perform this computationally expensive part of the analysis as efficiently as possible, we enable ROOT's implicit multi-threading and use RDataFrame in C++!"
---

In this step, the NanoAOD files containing data and simulated events are pre-processed. This step is called skimming since the event selection reduces the size of the datasets significantly. In addition, we perform a pair selection to find from the muon and tau collections the pair which is most likely to have originated from a Higgs boson.

This step is implemented in the file `skim.cxx` [here](../code/skim.cxx) and is written in C++ for performance reasons.

> ## Compile the C++ program!
> Use the following command and replace `g++` with the C++ compiler of your choice.
> ```bash
> g++ -O3 -o skim skim.cxx $(root-config --cflags --libs)
> ```

> ## Run the C++ program and investigate the output!
> Run it! Note that the program picks up the files from the same directory in which you run it. Also the results of this step are files in the same directory in which you have run the executable and have the filenames `*Skim.root`.
