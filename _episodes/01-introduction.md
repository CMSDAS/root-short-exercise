Hi there, a warm welcome to the lesson about efficient analysis with ROOT!

> ## What is ROOT?
> Most likely you were already in touch with ROOT! But in short, it's an open-source data analysis framework used by high energy physics and others, which let's you save and access your experiment's data, allows you to process the data in a computationally efficient and statistically sound way and gives you access to all tools to produce publication-quality results.

> ## What can I learn here?
> We would like to show you how you can perform efficient data analysis with ROOT! Starting with getting access to ROOT without any hassle, you will learn the advantages of ROOT in C++ and Python. Next, we want to introduce you to a selection of features, which we see commonly used in a typical analysis. Another ingredient for efficient analysis is a simple way to get help quickly and therefore you will learn where you can find support. The last sections introduce you to the modern way to process data with ROOT and walks you through a full analysis based on CMS NanoAOD files. You can learn how to go efficiently from the initial datasets to the result plots, all powered by ROOT!
