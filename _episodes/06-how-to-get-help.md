## The ROOT website, the beginner's guide and the topical manuals

The [ROOT website](https://root.cern) is home to the [beginner's guide](https://root.cern/primer/) and the more in depth [topical manuals](https://root.cern/manual/). These are a great resource to start with ROOT and learn about parts of the framework in high detail. Keep in mind the ROOT website on [https://root.cern](https://root.cern), which provides links to all resources in a single place!
